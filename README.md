# 18650_Hat_Node
I designed this as i wanted a small node i could put outside with a battery capable of being ouside.

A PCB design that is based off the DIY Pro-Micro, Firmware for Meshtastic. This is a smd version that can be ordered and just need to add the promicro and the lora chip(HT-RA62 footprint). Battery holder will also be needed separately as well. I'm open to improvements and modifications.
